## This project will contain tools to help people programming with Godot engine 3.4.x.

Installation:
- compile the project
- copy GDUtils.dll, GDUtils.pdb and GDUtils.xml
- paste them in your project (I recommend to create a folder "libraries" in the project)
- in Visual Studio, right click on the project file (.csproj)
- click on Add -> Project Reference -> Browse -> Browse... -> GDUtils.dll

It's now installed on your project :)

## I will most likely not add anything anymore since I don't have time to work on it
